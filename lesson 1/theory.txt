LESSON 2:

configuring npm
  -npm init

-Package.json is a configuration for npm 
Bundlers:
 -webpack(large resources that needs to be bundled)
 -parcel(easy configuration)
 -vite

Dependencies:
 -dev dependecy(during development)  (npm install -d parcel)
 -normal dependencya(also used in production)

 caret(^) and tilde(~)
   ^ - only upgrades to small updates
   ~ - even upgrades to large updates

Package.json and Package-lock.json
 -Package.json is a approx version of dependency
 -Package-lock.json is a exact version of dependency

Transative dependecy - Each dependency will have their own dependencies

Node modules - collections of all the dependencies


# Parcel 
  -Dev build 
  -Local Server 
  -HMR = Hot module Replacement
  -File watching Algo-written in c++
  -Caching - Faster Build 
  - Image Optimisation 
  -Minification 
  -Bundling 
  -Compress
  -Consistent Hashing 
  -Code Splitting 
  -Differential Bundling - supports older browsers 
  -Diagonostic for easy error handling 
  -HTTPs 
  -Tree shaking - remove less used code 
  -Different dev and prod bundles
